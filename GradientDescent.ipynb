    "<p>Many machine learning algorithms are optimized by finding the value of weights that minimize a loss function. This minimization is done using numerical optimization techniques, with one popular method being gradient descent. In this exercise you will find the minimum of a function using visual, brute force and gradient descent techniques. In our implementation of gradient descent, we will also explore how what we call the \"learning rate\" determines how fast it takes to find the minimum point."
